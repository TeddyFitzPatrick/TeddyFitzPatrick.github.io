        <b class="text-xl">Why these classes? </b>I enjoy learning about the laws of nature and building circuits,
        so I am pursuing a minor in physics and a minor in electrical engineering. I am looking to learn German to
        conversational fluency to study machine learning in Germany for my junior or senior year. 
        Additionally, I have been practicing piano for a few years in hopes of playing my favorite classical pieces.
        Lastly, I love racket sports, especially badminton.

        <b class="text-xl">Congratulations, you've made it to the end!<br> Here are my course recommendations if you're interested:</b>
        Out of the courses that I was not required to take, I would highly recommend both Modern Physics I and Gen & Analytical Chem I. Both of which are challenging, but if
        you are the type of person who likes science, these classes are really enjoyable. In Modern Physics I, we delved into many scientific concepts that I have heard about,
        but never got to explore in depth (i.e. Schrodinger's Equation, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, Bohr Model, Relativity). Gen & Analytical Chem I was difficult considering
        it was primarily for chem/bio majors, but it was fun learning about topics like combustion, enthalpy/entropy, and stoichiometry.<br>
        Out of my liberal arts courses, my favorite is definitely Public History & Public Debate with
        Professor Michael Brown. Instead of busywork and essays, the course consisted of class discussion which made it more engaging. We covered a lot of local Rochester
        history which was interesting.<br>
        Out of my CS courses, my favorite is Computer Science for AP Students. For a first-year class, we covered a lot of ground, with graph traversals, heaps, 
        networking, multi-threading, GitHub, and backtracking. Not an overly easy or difficult class with fair grading.
